	For this program it will take an image and remove the least noticavle parts of it one "seam" at a time. This will both be done
by horizontal and vertical lines. the image to be processed has to be in pgm gray scale formate or it will not be able to process. 
The image then needs to be called on call with how many vertical and horizontal lines should be seamed away so to call this program 
from the comannd line it should be "a.exe FileName.pgm 10 5 " in order to take away 10 vertical lines away and five horizontal lines 
from the image of that FileName.
